## Introduction

The goal of this experiment is to maximise the early growth of the Agriculture
industry starting with $150e9 with no corporate upgrades. The best strategy
will become a good starting position for any new corporation.

## Variables

Smart Supply is so useful that it will be bought all the time.

Because assets can be bought on loan, these are assumed to be purchased after
our initial investment is spent, and once all the employees have max energy
(working while the company is in debt seems to reduce energy, which is
detrimental to production).

The following factors have been identified as variables in these experiments:

- Storage space
- Employees
- Advertising
- DreamSense

## Measuring Success

After 30 minutes of production, the following measurements will be taken:

- Profit
- Debt
- Employee energy
- 10% share investment bid price
- IPO bid price

These factors can be wieghed to decide which opening is the strongest.

If the corporation is left with high amounts of debt and low employee energy,
then it is unlikely that it can sustain whatever profit it is making, even if
the profit is high early on.

Otherwise, the profit followed by the stock bid prices will be used to
determine the most successful strategy.
