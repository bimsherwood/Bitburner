## Better Thief

Run concurrent scripts for:
  - weaken (constantly)
  - grow (keeping track of a target weakness)
  - hack (keep track of a target weekness and size)

Make the scripts run on only a few threads each so that there is a smoother
growth and hack rate, which will prevent wasted effort on servers that have
tighter limits.
